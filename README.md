Features
5 Degrees of Freedom: The robotic arm features 5 joints, providing a wide range of motion and flexibility.

STM32 Microcontroller: The main control unit is powered by an STM32 microcontroller, offering a robust and efficient platform for real-time control.

Modular Design: The robotic arm is designed with a modular approach, allowing for easy customization and expansion. Each joint is a standalone module, making it simple to replace or upgrade individual components.

Inverse Kinematics: The firmware incorporates inverse kinematics algorithms to convert end-effector coordinates to joint angles, ensuring precise control and positioning.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface is provided to control the robotic arm. This can be via a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer or a simple control panel on the robot itself.

Hardware Requirements
STM32 Microcontroller (e.g., STM32F4 or STM32F7 series)
Motor Drivers (compatible with the selected motors)
DC Motors or Servo Motors for each joint
Power Supply
Sensors for Feedback (optional)
Communication Modules (e.g., UART, USB)
